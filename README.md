# data_collection_challenge

This is my submission for Module 11 Challenge with Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.

The data.csv and .ipynb files can be found above in this repo.

Running part_1_mars_news.ipynb will give you a notebook that is used to scrape a website with articles about mars. Running part_2_mars_weather.ipynb will give you a notebook that can scrape a table from a website about mars, then use this data to build a dataframe and some graphs.
